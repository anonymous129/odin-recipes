   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the Base:</strong>
         Put the flour into a <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/top-five-mixing-bowls">large bowl</a>, then
         stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the
         olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly
         floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the
         dough to rise if you like, but it's not essential for a thin crust.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.
         Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/test-best-rolling-pins">Roll out</a> the dough:</strong>
         if youâ€™ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out
         the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will
         rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Top and bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned
         baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese
         and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the
         preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves
         if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
   </ol>
